      <div class="panel">

          <p>
            SIM Card Checker is an application that I created to automate SIM
            Card file system checking against specification. As a result we were
            able to reliably check if SIM cards we received from vendors matched
            our expectations.
          </p>
          <p>Short description how SIM Card Checker worked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Select specification file, where content of each file was
                defined
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                SIM card gets activated and authenticated with necesarry keys
                (PIN, PUK codes)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We ittereate through each file and compare if it's content
                mathces content in specification
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>As output HTML file was generated with results.</p></li>

            During my study period in Griffith College our final assignment were
            to create a music palyer application. In this project we used our
            knowledge about accessing files, building interface and managing
            controls that you would associate with any decent music player.

            On my learning journey I enrolled with CodeCademy on Front-End
            developer path. All this experience I would call one one project.
            Here is combination of various exercises/smaller projects that I
            have completed along my learning journey. Including this portfolio -
            it is a project on it's own and also part of CodeCademy course and
            another step in my learning journey.
