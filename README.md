# Personal Portfolio Project

Personal portfolio is exactly that - my personal web page that would give a little insight in who I am and what is my experiences.

Visiting this page people would get:
- An overview information about what I am, what I do
- Programming skills that I have learned so far
- Some of programming projects I have worked on
- Insight in my background: education and work history
- Also how to get in touch with me
