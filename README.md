# Personal Portfolio Project

Personal portfolio is exactly that - my personal web page that would give a little insight in who I am and what is my experiences.

Visiting this page people would get:

- An overview information about what I am, what I do
- Programming skills that I have learned so far
- Some of programming projects I have worked on
- Insight in my background: education and work history
- Also how to get in touch with me

## How to run it?

There are several ways how you could run this project.

- Open the file with 'Live Server' from Visual Studio Code or other similar application that can be used for code editor.
- Open any from .html files in the projects directly in the browser (I would suggest index.html)
