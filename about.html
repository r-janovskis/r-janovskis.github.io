        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Reinis. <br />I come from Latvia, but for a while now
          Ireland has been a place where I live. I'm an engineer who likes to
          explore - new ideas, areas or outdoors (far and close). Even though
          I'm Physicist by education, most of my professional life I have spent
          in technology field - working with SIM cards or system monitoring and
          process management systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along side my work duties I like to explore new concepts and for years
          I have played around with coding. Few years ago I enrolled in Griffith
          College and earned my Higher Diploma in Computing Science. Now I'm
          continuing my journey and explorations in programming and coding with
          CodeCademy where I have enrolled on Front-End developer path.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy a good book, which gives a chance to explore
          new ideas and let's me see some things in a different light. I also
          love activities - crossFit, jogs, strolls, longs hikes, bicycle
          rides... Pretty much everything that gives a chance to wind off after
          long day (or week) and explore, and test existing skills while slowly
          learning new onse.
